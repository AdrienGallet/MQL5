//--- Purpose ---
This repository show-cases my work done in MQL5 for the Metatrader 5 (MT5) software.
Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions!

//--- Programming Language Overview ---
The MQL5 programming language is identical to C++ (compiled, OOP capabilities, multi-core processing, etc.).
However, it features additional functions to interact with MT5 (event and trading functions, etc.).
Therefore, MQL5 is a C++ derived programming language with an in-built custom library for trading operations.

//--- Content ---
